# Scripts for After a Clean Install to Automate Setup

I'm in IT. I do a lot of testing of new applications or random projects on my Mac.
I tend to either break it or notice slow downs every few months.
I usually clean install at that point.
Thus I created this script so I would not have to re-setup every setting and
download every application.

## How to use

1. Clone the Repo or download
2. cd to the folder in Terminal
3. Run `chmod +x cleaninstall.sh installCommandlineTool.sh`
4. Run the script without `sudo`
  * `./cleaninstall.sh`
5. Watch it go! You will be prompted for any input.


Feel free to modify it at your pleasure.
